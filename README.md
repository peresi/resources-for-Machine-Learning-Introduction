# Machine Learning Introduction

Machine Learning is field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly programmed. 
Machine learning is great for the technique of finding solution or getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data.

When machine learning used to dig into large amount of data can help discover patterns that were not immediately apparent.
Also, the application of machine learning has in recent year become in our every day life that modern system and application 
have machine learning algorithm at their cores

There are types of machine learning and are classified into different classes.

    Classification of machine learning based to the amount and type of supervision they get during training 
        (Supervised, Unsupervised, Semisupervised and Reinforcement Learning)

    Classification of machine learning based whether the system can learn itself from the stream of incoming data 
        (Batch learning and online Learning)

    Classification of machine learning based on how they are generalizing 
        (Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning)
  
# Main challenges of machine learnig
  
  are Bad Algorithm and Bad data 

when you use poor quality of data, irrelevant features and 
insufficient quantity of training data can lead to have poor performance of the problem that you are trying to solve. 

Then its very important to have a representation of our input data that computer can understand, 
no machine learning algorithm will able to make the prediction on data for which has no information.

Most important part of machine learnig process is understand of data that you are working with and 
how it relates to task you want to solve because each algorithm that we implement to ML is different in term of what kind of data and 
what problem setting it best for.

# Why Python

Python has become the Lingua Franca for many data science application because it combines the power of general-purpose programming language 
with the ease of use of domain specific scripting language like MATLAB or R

# Advantages of using python 

the ability to interact directly with code, using terminal / other tools like the Jupyter notebook. 

second, python has libraries for data loading, visualization, scientistic, Natural language processing, Image processing and more. 

lastly, python allow for the creation of complex GUI and web services

#

With python distribution, provides the necessary packages like Anaconda, Enthought Canopy and Python(x,y) but for anaconda support window os, mac and Linux and comes with all libraries for free, 
for Enthought Canopy support window, Linux and mac but comes with all libraries for free except Scikit-learn 
and for Python(x,y) support on window os and comes with all libraries as anaconda. 

And those libraries are like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, IPython, Jupyter Notebook, and sciekit-learn.
  	If you have python installation setup you can use pip install to install these packages.

# Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Artificial Intelligence: Enable a computer to do think, the effort is to automate intellectual task normally performed by humans.
With artificial Intelligence is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning

Then machine learning is a substance of AI that enable computer to learn from data while deep learnig focuses even 
more narrowly a subset of machine learning tools and techniques and applies them to solving just about any problem 
which requires through human or artificial.

With Deep Learnig involve feeding a computer system a lot of data, which it can use to make decision about other data. 
This can be fed as is the case of neural network as is the case of machine learnig
